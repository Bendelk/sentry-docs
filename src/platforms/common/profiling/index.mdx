description: "Learn how to enable profiling in your app if it is not already set up."

<Note>

Profiling is still an experimental, work-in-progress feature, and its API may be unstable. It may also have bugs. Feedback is appreciated, and should be submitted as an issue in the repository linked on the right side of this page.

</Note>

<Note>

If you don't have access to Profiling please reach out to [profiling@sentry.io](mailto:profiling@sentry.io).

</Note>

With [profiling](/product/profiling/), Sentry allows you to collect and analyze performance profiles from real user devices in production to give you a complete picture of how your application performs in a variety of environments.

## Enable Performance Monitoring

Profiling depends on Sentryâ€™s performance monitoring product being enabled beforehand. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK:

<PlatformSection supported={["apple"]}>

```swift
SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "..."
    options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0
}
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["android"]}>

In `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.dsn" android:value="..." />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
</application>
```

</PlatformSection>

See the <PlatformLink to="/performance/">documentation</PlatformLink> for more detailed information on how to configure sampling. Setting the sample rate to 1.0 means all transactions will be captured. By default, some transactions will be created automatically for common operations like loading a view controller/activity and app startup.

## Enable Profiling

<PlatformSection supported={["apple"]}>

```swift
SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "..."
    options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0
    options.profilesSampleRate = 1.0
}
```

<Note>

The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles-sample-rate" /> setting is *relative* to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> setting.

</Note>

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["android"]}>

In `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.dsn" android:value="..." />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.profiling.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
</application>
```

<Note>

The `io.sentry.traces.profiling.sample-rate` setting is *relative* to the `io.sentry.traces.sample-rate` setting.

</Note>

</PlatformSection>

## Troubleshooting

If you do not see any profiling data in Sentry, you can try the following

- Ensure that performance monitoring <PlatformLink to="/performance/">is enabled</PlatformLink>.
- Ensure that the automatic instrumentation is sending performance data to Sentry by going to the Performance page in your dashboard.
- If the automatic instrumentation is not sending performance data, try using <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
- Enable the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#debug">debug mode</PlatformLink> in the SDK and check the logs.
